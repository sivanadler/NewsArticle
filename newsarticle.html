			<p id="para1">SAN FRANCISCO -- For nearly two years, Facebook has appeared bulletproof despite a series of scandals about the misuse of its giant social network.</p>	

			<p id="para2">But the Silicon Valley companys streak ended on Wednesday when it said that the accumulation of issues was starting to hurt its multibillion-dollar business -- and that the costs are set to continue playing out for months.</p>

			<p id="para3">Facebook reported on Wednesday that growth in digital advertising sales and in the number of its users had decelerated in the second quarter. The companys leaders, including its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, added that the trajectory was not likely to improve anytime soon, especially as Facebook spends to improve the privacy and security of users.</p>

			<p id="para4">Facebook has grappled with months of scrutiny over Russian misuse of the platform in the 2016 American presidential campaign and the harvesting of its users data through the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The results were among the first signs that the issues had pierced the companys image and would have a lasting effect on its moneymaking machine.</p>

			<p id="para5">In response, Facebooks stock tumbled more than 23 percent in after-hours trading, erasing more than $120 billion in market value in less than two hours. If those losses hold up through regular trading on Thursday, the one-day stock decline will be the biggest in Facebooks history.</p>

			<p id="para6">'This is a fork-in-the-road situation for Facebook' said Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research for GBH Insights, a marketing research firm. He said the challenges included regaining public trust as well as increasing the number of people joining Facebook and the time they spent on the platform.</p>

			<p id="para7">Facebook reported a 42 percent increase in revenue and a 31 percent jump in profits for its second quarter, compared with a year earlier. But the revenue of $13.2 billion missed Wall Street estimates of $13.4 billion. In addition, Facebook said its daily active users rose 11 percent from a year earlier to 1.47 billion, compared with 13 percent growth in the previous quarter.</p>

			<p id="para8">On a conference call to discuss earnings, Mr. Zuckerberg said profits would most likely take a further hit because the company planned to spend more on security. </p>
